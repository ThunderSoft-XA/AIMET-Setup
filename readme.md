# AIMET Setup Developer documentation

## brief introduction
Google colab is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, 
and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, 
while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.

AIMET is a library that provides advanced model quantization and compression techniques for trained neural network models. 
It provides features that have been proven to improve run-time performance of deep learning neural network models with lower compute and memory requirements and minimal impact to task accuracy.

This project shows how to install pytorch AIMET packages in Google Colab environment, let users have a preliminary understanding of AIMET.

## The main development process:
1. show how to set up Google colab environment
2. Show how to build a AIMET environment at Google colab

Please refer to <Project Dir>/doc/Detailed_introduction_of_AIMET_Setup.docx for detail.
